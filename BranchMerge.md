## git branch
```bash
git branch
```

### What it does:
This allows you to see all the local branches

### Narrative:
When used you can see your current branch since it will have the '*' symbol next to it. This is also 
the basis for creating and deleting branches, which you need to add after the branch portion to do.

## git branch <branch-name>
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

### What it does:
This creates a new branch

### Narrative:
Coming from you current branch, you create a new branch. Keep it mind that this command only creates it,
you must mannually switch to said branch in order to work on it.
