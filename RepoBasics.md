## git init
```bash
git init
```
### What it does:
Makes and initializes a new git repository. This can be either a brand new one, or an existing one

### Narrative:
This is the very first step when starting a new project. You need to do this step in order to access all the
other git commands.


## git clone
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
### What it does:
Takes a pre-existing repository, and copies it to your remote machine

### Narrative:
When working in a collaborative environment, a main repository may already exist. When this happens cloning
gives you access to all the files and changes at that point in time. This gives you a wokring copy to make
your own changes to.
