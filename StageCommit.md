All the changes in regards to staging and tracking are shown with this command. Staged and unstaged may even show
in a different color depending on the ide used.

## git add
```bash
git add <file>
```
### What it does:
Takes a change made and moves it onto the staging phase

### Narrative:
Affectivly a pre-planning step, where an update is almost ready to be commited. Since it is only a pre-commit step
until the commit command is ran, the change is not fully recorded yet to the repository.
